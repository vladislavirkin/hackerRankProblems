# Problem solving. Intermediate. Bitwise And.

Given an array of non-negative integers, count the number of undordered pairs of array elements such tha their bitwise And is a power of 2.

For example:
arr = [10, 7, 2, 8, 3] :
- (0, 1) 10 & 7 = 2, which is a power of 2.
- (0, 2) 10 & 2 = 2, which is a power of 2.
- (0, 3) 10 & 8 = 8, which is a power of 2.
- (0, 4) 10 & 3 = 2, which is a power of 2.
- (1, 2) 7 & 2 = 2, which is a power of 2.
- (2, 4) 2 & 3 = 2, which is a power of 2.
