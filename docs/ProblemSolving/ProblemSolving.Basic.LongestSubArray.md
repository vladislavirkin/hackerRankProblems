# Problem solving. Basic. LongestSubArray

Input: Given an array of integers.
Problem: What is the length of the longest subArray containing no more than two distinct values such that the distinct values differ by no more than 1.

Output: longest subarray.

For Example:

```
arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] -> length = 4; [1,2,1,2]

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> length = 2; [1,2]

arr = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2] -> length = 4; [3,3,2,2]
```
